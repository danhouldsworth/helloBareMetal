# TASK

1. Using a simple blocking delay, blink a LED at roughly 1Hz.
2. Use NOP to simplify the loop.
3. Experiment with different fuse clock settings, and different Chips

## Notes:

* While this technique of timing - ie delay() or wait() - should never be used in a production project, it's a decent milestone for us as gives confidence that we understand execution of steps, clock speed of chip, branching & loop counting etc.
* Seeing a LED blink at the speed you told it too, is always encouraging at this stage in our development :-)
