# Task

1. Using a push button, and 2 LEDs, make an alternating flash that stops when you let go.


## Bonus:

* Experiment with using both physical pull up resisters and setting the internal ones.
* What would happen if we used the input switch to toggle the LED?

## Notice : The .hex flash is 50 times larger for C than for Assembly!!
