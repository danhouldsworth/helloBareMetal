# Task

1. Set a GPIO pin to output, and switch it on. Test by lighting a LED.
2. Using a simple blocking delay, blink the LED at roughly 1Hz.
3. Make the LED increase and decrease in brightness by varying its dutycycle.
4. Using a push button and 2 LEDs, make an alternating flash that halts while you press.

# Further learning :
* Experiment with using both physical pull up resisters and setting the internal ones.
* What would happen if we used the input switch to toggle the LED?
