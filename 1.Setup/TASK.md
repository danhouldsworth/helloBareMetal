# Task

1. Write a Makefile that compiles and flashes a trivial program onto a target MCU.
2. Extend it to have ```make clean``` and ```make flash``` capabilities.
3. Extend it to enable the setting of the device MCU fuses, and reading of the device ROM, EEPROM & fuses.
4. Set the fuses such that it needs no external oscillator.


## Notes:

* See http://eleccelerator.com/fusecalc/fusecalc.php?chip=atmega328p for fuse settings
