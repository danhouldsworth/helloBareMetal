# Task

1. Write a Makefile that compiles and uploads a trivial (empty loop) program onto a target device.
2. Extend it have ```make clean``` and ```make flash``` capabilities.

## Bonus learning :

1. What does .phony do in a Makefile? Do we need it? How would we use it?
2. What does avr-objcopy do? What are the arguments and outputs?
3. What does avr-ar do? What is the difference between linking a file.o at compile time vs linking a core library?
