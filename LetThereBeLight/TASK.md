# Task

1. Write & flash a program to set a GPIO pin to output, and switch it on. Test by lighting a LED.
2. Adjust the program to light one LED and leave another one off. Test by toggling this and re-flashing.

Bonus1. Tackle the above without any use of included libraries.
Bonus2. Now do it in assembly language - again with no libraries!
